Working with JavaScript to create a password generator. 

Very new to JavaScript and this is my first time really utilizing it!

    Watched this video to help plan on how to execute the project. Very well done tutorial. I included a separate .js file I used to follow along. Along with general googling I learned quite a bit and helped me understand the logic better. It's a much different approach than I was planning but I did incorporate some into my generator.
