# Password-o-Matic
Working with JavaScript to create a password generator. 

Very new to JavaScript and this is my first time really utilizing it!

There are 3 javascript files.

script.js - 
    user selects types of characters to use and a function throws all the available characters into an array and randomly generates a password from there. Had issues with low password length not selecting a character type selected by the user. Mostly worked but wanted a cleaner product.

scriptFinal.js -
    This is the script currently linked to the HTML. After having issues with the original script I started fresh and tried to incorporate some of the bobross.js ideas (coded along to an instructional video I found on youtube) into this script. I wanted to make sure at least one of the selected types from the type choices was incorporated in smaller password lengths.

Watched this video to help plan on how to execute the project. Very well done tutorial. I included the bobross.js file I used to follow along. Along with general research I learned quite a bit and helped me understand the logic better. It's a much different approach than I was planning but I did try and incorporate some of the logic into my final generator.
